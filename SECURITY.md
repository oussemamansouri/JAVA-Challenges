1. **Creating a private issue:** 
    * Submit a new issue on the project's issue tracker, marking it as **"Private"** or **"Confidential."** 
    * Clearly and concisely describe the vulnerability and its potential impact.
    * Do not publicly disclose any details of the vulnerability until it has been addressed.

2. **Emailing the maintainers:** Contact the project maintainers directly via email (replace with actual email addresses) to report the issue privately.

**Security Vulnerability Disclosure Process**

1. **Acknowledgement:** Upon receiving a security report, the project maintainers will acknowledge receipt within [ timeframe, e.g., 2 business days ].
2. **Investigation:** The maintainers will investigate the reported issue promptly and determine its severity and validity.
3. **Remediation:** If the reported issue is valid, the maintainers will work diligently to develop and deploy a fix or mitigation strategy.
4. **Communication:** The maintainers will coordinate with the reporter to keep them informed about the progress of the investigation and remediation efforts.
5. **Public Disclosure:** After the issue has been resolved, the maintainers may choose to publicly disclose the vulnerability and its resolution in a security advisory or release notes. However, this will be done in a way that minimizes the risk of exploitation.

**Confidentiality**

The project maintainers will treat all security reports confidentially and will not disclose any information about the reported vulnerability or the reporter to third parties without their explicit consent.
