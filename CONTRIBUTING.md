# Contributing to Java Challenges

We welcome contributions to the Java Challenges repository! This document outlines the guidelines for submitting your own challenges or improving existing solutions.

## How to Contribute

There are two main ways you can contribute to this project:

* **Adding new challenges:**
    * Create a new folder for your challenge under the `challenges` directory.
    * Inside the folder, create two files:
        * `challenge.md`: This file should describe the problem statement and any specific requirements for the challenge.
        * `solution.java`: This file should contain the well-documented Java code that solves the challenge.
* **Improving existing solutions:**
    * If you find an existing solution that can be improved, feel free to submit a pull request with your changes.
    * Make sure your changes are well-documented and adhere to the coding style of the project.

## Contribution Guidelines

* **Challenge format:**
    * The `challenge.md` file should clearly explain the problem statement and any specific requirements for the challenge.
    * Use clear and concise language, avoiding jargon or overly technical terms.
    * You can include examples of input and output to illustrate the challenge.
* **Solution format:**
    * The `solution.java` file should contain well-documented Java code that solves the challenge.
    * Use clear variable names and meaningful comments to explain your code.
    * Follow consistent formatting and indentation conventions.
    * Adhere to best practices for Java coding, such as exception handling and efficient algorithms.
* **Testing:**
    * Make sure your solution works correctly for the provided examples and any edge cases.
    * You can add unit tests to ensure the correctness of your solution.
* **Pull requests:**
    * When submitting a pull request, please provide a clear description of your changes.
    * Make sure your code is formatted correctly and follows the contribution guidelines.

## Code Style
