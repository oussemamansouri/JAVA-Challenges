# Insertion Sort

Write a method named `insertionSort` that sorts an array of integers using 
the insertion sort algorithm and returns the sorted array.

## Hint:
Insertion sort considers each element of the array and inserts it in the correct position among 
the already sorted elements. Thus, when an element is considered, the elements before it are already 
sorted, while the elements after it are not yet sorted.

## Example Output:

Input: { 12, 11, 13, 5, 6 }
Output: 5 6 11 12 13
