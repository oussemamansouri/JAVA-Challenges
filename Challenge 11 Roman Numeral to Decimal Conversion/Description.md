# Roman Numeral to Decimal Conversion

Write a method named `convertRomanToDecimal` that takes a string representing a Roman numeral as a parameter and returns its value as a decimal number.
Call the `convertRomanToDecimal` method in the `main` function.

## Hint:
Roman numerals are an additive system represented by the symbols I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, which respectively represent the numbers 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000.
A number written in Roman numerals is read from left to right, and its value is determined by summing the individual values of each symbol, except when a symbol precedes a symbol of higher value; in this case, the value of the first symbol is subtracted from the second.

## Example Output:

- Input: XXVIII
- Output: 28
- Input: DCLXVI
- Output: 666
