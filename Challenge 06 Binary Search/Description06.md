# Binary Search

Write a method named `binarySearch` that takes a sorted array of integers and a target value as input, and returns the index of the target value in the array (or -1 if the value is not present).

## Hint:
In binary search, an array is repeatedly divided into two halves until the key (the element being searched for) is found.

## Example Output:
Input: array = { 2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91 }; and 23.

Output: "The value 23 is present at index: 5."

Input: array = { 2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91 }; and 15.

Output: "The value 15 is not present in the array."
