## Coin Change Problem

Given an array of coins representing different denominations and an integer `sum`, the task is to create a method called `count` to find the number of possible combinations of coins needed to reach the given sum.

### Example Output

**Input:**  

```java
  int[] coins = {1, 2, 3}
  int sum = 4;
```
**Output:**  
Number of ways to reach sum 4: 4

**Possible combinations:**

- {1, 1, 1, 1}
- {1, 1, 2}
- {2, 2}
- {1, 3}
