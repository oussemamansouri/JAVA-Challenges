# Fibonacci Sequence Generation

Write a method named `fibonacciSequence` that takes an integer n as a parameter and 
displays the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
Call the `fibonacciSequence` method in the `main` function.

## Hint:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of integers where each successive term 
is the sum of the two preceding ones.

## Example Output:

Input: 10
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
