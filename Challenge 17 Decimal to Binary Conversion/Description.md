# Decimal to Binary Conversion

This project provides a method named `decimalToBinary` to convert a positive integer in decimal to its binary representation as a string of characters. The `decimalToBinary` method is invoked within the `main` function.

## Instructions

To convert a decimal number to a binary number (in base B = 2), use successive integer divisions by 2 until the quotient becomes zero. The result will be the concatenation of remainders. The most significant bit corresponds to the remainder obtained at the final step of the division.

## Example Output

Input: 23
Output: The decimal number 23 in binary is: 10111
