## Counting Character Occurrences in a String

Write a method named `countOccurrences` that takes a string, a character, and a boolean indicating if the search should be case-sensitive and consider special characters. This method should return the number of occurrences of the character in the string.

**Example Output:**

**Input:** `("Hello world! The weather is nice today.", 'b', false)`  
**Output:** `2`
