### Implement a Stack using Queues

Given a queue data structure that supports standard operations such as `enqueue` and `dequeue`, the task is to implement a stack data structure using only queue instances and the queue operations allowed on those instances.

Create the `Stack` class that includes:

- A single attribute `queue` of type `Queue<Integer>`: To implement this, use the `LinkedList` class: `Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();`

- The standard stack methods: `push()`, `pop()`, `top()`, and `size()`.
